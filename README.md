# GarbageCollectSystem Project

This project is with garbage collection system..

This project formed  of tiers of DataAccess , Entities ,  UI .

#Entities Tier

 - Vehicle and Container class corresponds to the table in the database.I marked this class by IEntity interfaces.Because , I  report classes which marked by IEntity are table of databases.

#DataAccess Tier 

 - I defined operations which I do on the database in IRepositoryBase.
 - I used Entity Framework for connect to database.But you can use Dapper Library for connect.You should fill with  operations of  Dapper  to Dapper Repository classes.
 - I used Unit of Work and Repository Pattern in here.
 - I used  MSSQL  as database.

#UI Tier

  I created Web Api project in here . This api is doing operation with datas of vehicle and container.

#ABOUT FOLDER OF UI TIER
